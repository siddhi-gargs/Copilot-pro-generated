I wanted you to create a full todo-app in which i wanted you to give it proper and simple css property so it will look nicer 
frontend 
  - use react
Backend 
  - use Csharp

I am expected from you to write cleaner code with the proper serperation and using all the good practices and also backend and frontend should have proper connectivity if you feel that there can be coros issue then keep in mind and also fix it
 - proper seperation of folders
 - In csharp use
    - services
    - dependency Injection
    - controller with proper name and all the crud operations
    - Interfaces
    - proper seperated program.cs 
    - if you are using any advance package which is not common add comments properly

- In react 
  - css should be clean and simple 
  - properly use react componenent
  - use react hooks as much as you can use
  - make decisions wisely so you won't be doing anything not necessary
  
- In the end you have to make an md file in which you write a flow how you did all in a proper way

- seperate file in which you will write what all issue if would probably face making such a project

If you have still any issue first clear it with me then only start generating
